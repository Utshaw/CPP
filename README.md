# Compilers
- C++ is a compiled programming language
- Doesn't have any official compiler
## GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
- g++ program compiles C++ source code and automatically links the C++ standard library
- In order to use those classes and functions from the C++ standard library the compiler must have access to the compiled version of the standard library stored in object files
- The compiler links the standard library object files to the object files created from the programmer's source code
# Namespace
- All standard library functions, classes exist in std:: namespace, std::vector refer to verctor class
